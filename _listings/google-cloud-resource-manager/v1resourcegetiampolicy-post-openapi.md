        Request that a new Project be created. The result is an Operation which
        can be used to track the creation process. It is automatically deleted
        after a few hours, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation.

        Our SLO permits Project creation to take up to 30 seconds at the 90th
        percentile. As of 2016-08-29, we are observing 6 seconds 50th percentile
        latency. 95th percentile latency is around 11 seconds. We recommend
        polling at the 5th second with an exponential backoff.

      summary: Delete Project
      description: |-
        Marks the Project identified by the specified
        `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion.
        This method will only affect the Project if the following criteria are met:

        + The Project does not have a billing account associated with it.
        + The Project has a lifecycle state of
        ACTIVE.

        This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from
        ACTIVE
        to DELETE_REQUESTED.
        The deletion starts at an unspecified time,
        at which point the Project is no longer accessible.

        Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state
        checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject,
        and the Project remains visible to ListProjects.
        However, you cannot update the project.

        After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by
        the  GetProject and
        ListProjects methods.

        The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.

  /v1/projects/{resource}:setIamPolicy:
    post:
      summary: Set IAM Policy
      description: |-
        Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. Replaces
        any existing policy.

        The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:

        + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
        `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.

        + The owner role can be granted only to `user` and `serviceAccount`.

        + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
        without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
        invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.

        + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
        must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
        explicitly accept the invitation.

        + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
        `setIamPolicy()`;
        they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.

        + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
        accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.

        + There must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of
        Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to
        to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This
        restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners
        who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until
        the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified.

        + Calling this method requires enabling the App Engine Admin API.

        Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles
        can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand
        how the service account is being used before removing or updating its
        roles.
